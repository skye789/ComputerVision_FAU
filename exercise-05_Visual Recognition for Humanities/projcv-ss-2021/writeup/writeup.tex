%
% TO COMPILE:
% > pdflatex thisfile.tex
%
% For references to appear correctly instead of as '??', you must run
% pdflatex twice.

\section*{Project Overview}

One of the major factors in science and research is to present your work. For any project, programming is important and must, however how you present your experiments is more important than the experiment itself as this is what the readers are going to see before looking at your code. Hence, it is of foremost importance to be able to explain your experiments. See Equation~\ref{eq:one}.

\begin{equation}
Great~Research = Good~Experiments + Good~Writing
\label{eq:one}
\end{equation}

\section*{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Give a brief overview about how your project is organized. 
	\item Describe any interesting decisions you made to write your algorithm.
	\item Show and discuss the results of your algorithm.
	\item Feel free to include code snippets (and not the entire code), images, and equations.
	\item List any extra credit implementation and result (optional).
	\item Page-limit is 5 pages (excluding references).
\end{itemize}


\section*{Implementation Detail}

My code snippet highlights an interesting point.
\begin{python}
one = 1;
two = one + one;
if two == 2
    disp( 'This computer is not broken.' );
end
\end{python}

\section*{Result}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Result 1 was a total failure, because...
    \item Result 2 (Figure~\ref{fig:result1}, left) was surprising, because...
    \item Result 3 (Figure~\ref{fig:result1}, right) blew my socks off, because...
\end{enumerate}

My results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:table1}.

\begin{table}[h]

    \begin{tabular}{lr}
        \toprule
        Condition & Time (seconds) \\
        \midrule
        Test 1 & 1 \\
        Test 2 & 1000 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Stunning revelation about the efficiency of my code.}

\section*{Extra Credit (Optional)}
\begin{enumerate}
   
    \item Implementation A, code snippets, and results
        \begin{python}
        one = 1;
        two = one + one;
        if two == 2
            disp( 'This computer is not broken.' );
        end
        \end{python}
    
    \item Implementation B, code snippets, and results
        \begin{python}
        one = 1;
        two = one + one;
        if two == 2
            disp( 'This computer is not broken.' );
        end
